# Getting Your Data Model Added to the Harmonization API

## Overview

The Netrias Harmonization platform is intentionally **data model agnostic**. If you maintain a data model built around [Common Data Elements](what-we-harmonize.md) (CDEs) or something fairly similar and would like it available as a first‑class *target schema* inside our API, we’re happy to ingest it.

Adding a schema means that:

* `/cde-recommendation` can suggest your CDEs when users present matching columns.
* `/harmonize` can map free‑text values to the permissible values you define.

Just follow the request process below to get things started.

| 1  | **✅**     | **Schema file**             | JSON Schema (`*.json`) *or* YAML (`*.yml`) that enumerates every CDE (field name, description, type). | Make sure it parses with `jsonschema` or `yamllint`.     |
| 2  | **✅**     | **CDE dictionary**          | For each CDE: description, permissible values (if any). CSV or JSON OK.         | Use UTF‑8.         |
